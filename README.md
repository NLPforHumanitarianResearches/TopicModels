# Topic modeling in humanitarian researches
### In this work shows the possibilities of topic modeling as a tool to support humanitarian research related to text analysis. The two most well-known models are compared and some aspects of the use of this toolkit in semantic text research are considered. 
### The main task of the work is to compare the capabilities of the two most well-known topic modeling algorithms in order to obtain "good topics" and determine the sequence of actions necessary for this with relatively modest computing resources.
### The experimental results showed that it is advisable to use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) models as a basic tool to support text analysis. NMF-algorithms provide a fairly high quality of semantic analysis, and, unlike large language models, are characterized by very modest requirements for the hardware resources used, which makes it possible for a wide range of humanitarian researchers to use this toolkit.
